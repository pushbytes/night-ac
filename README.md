If you're reading this welcome, this is an anti-cheat developed by me and who ever contributes. This was made because I dislike all current foss anti-cheats and they don't really show anything in general.<br/>


This is supposed to be a highly advanced user-mode anti-cheat (that I want to make cross-platform soon)<br/>
It's general idea is to detect most things using some obscure methods that isn't too well documented.<br/>


## contributions
You might want to contribute to `night-ac` you can, but be aware of stuff such as race conditions and alike which might be prone to exploiting, crashes or other issues.<br/>
Make sure you use smart pointers and proper destructors as yk, we don't want a memory leak or something!<br/>
I'm not entirely focused on stuff like obfuscation as it's just obscure and I'm not experienced with that kind of thing.<br/>
It's recommend that you use `snake_case` over other typing formats as that's what my codebase uses.<br/>


## commerical usage
You can use and/or buy this for what ever price idrc but don't go around selling your copy of this as it's highly unethical to do that.<br/>
If you're a company or something who wants to message me go ahead and do that on Discord (@hyperion.v4 on discord)
